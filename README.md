# TDDGreetingKata
My attempted solution to, https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki/Greeting-Kata

A TDD exercise (Kata) on what starts to be a simple function, but gets functionality added to it.

This repository is my attempt to write unit tests and the code to pass those tests. Also, the challenge is to refactor the
code make it as readable as possible, and liberate the code of the nested if conditions and for loops.
